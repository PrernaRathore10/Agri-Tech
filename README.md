# Agri-Tech IoT Fire Prevention Solution

## Problem Statement

In regions experiencing heatwaves, the risk of frictional fires in agricultural areas due to dry soil conditions poses a significant threat to crops, property, and lives. Traditional methods of fire prevention may not be sufficient to address this challenge effectively.

## Solution Overview

Agri-Tech introduces an innovative IoT-based solution to mitigate the risk of frictional fires caused by heatwaves in agricultural settings. By leveraging IoT technology, specifically soil moisture sensors and temperature-humidity sensors (DHT11), combined with a microcontroller (ESP8266), relay module, and water pump, our solution offers an automated and proactive approach to fire prevention.

## Solution Components

- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Monitors the moisture percentage in the soil.
  
- **DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor:** Measures the temperature in the environment.
  
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller:** Processes sensor data and controls the operation of the relay module.
  
- **Relay Module:** Acts as a switch to control the water pump.
  
- **Water Pump:** Sprays water to moisten the soil when activated.

## Operation

1. **Soil Moisture Sensing:** The soil moisture sensor continuously monitors the moisture percentage in the soil.
   
2. **Temperature Sensing:** The DHT11 sensor measures the temperature in the environment.
   
3. **Decision Making:** 
   - If the soil moisture percentage falls below 20%, indicating dry soil conditions, the system activates the water pump to moisten the soil.
   - If the temperature exceeds 31Â°C, indicative of high heat levels, the system also activates the water pump to dampen the soil and reduce the risk of frictional fires.
   - If neither condition is met, the system remains in standby mode, conserving water and energy.

4. **Water Pump Activation:** Upon meeting the criteria for soil moisture or temperature, the ESP8266 microcontroller triggers the relay module to activate the water pump, which sprays water onto the soil.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:** The system continues to monitor soil moisture and temperature levels, adjusting the operation of the water pump as necessary to maintain optimal conditions for fire prevention.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Fire Prevention:** By automatically moistening the soil in response to dry conditions and high temperatures, the solution reduces the risk of frictional fires, safeguarding crops, property, and lives.

- **Resource Efficiency:** The automated nature of the system ensures efficient water usage, activating the water pump only when necessary based on real-time environmental conditions.

- **Scalability:** The solution can be scaled to accommodate varying farm sizes and environmental conditions, offering flexibility and adaptability to different agricultural settings.

Agri-Tech's IoT Fire Prevention Solution offers a proactive and sustainable approach to mitigating the risk of frictional fires during heatwaves, ensuring the safety and security of agricultural operations.
